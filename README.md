# API
I was presented with an intriguing taskâ€”to fetch weather data from an API. Recalling my previous encounter with API interactions during my training at DataCamp, I realized that relying solely on `pd.read_csv()` didn't cover all the intricacies involved, and some aspects, like the concept of a base URL, slipped my mind.

Determined to overcome this challenge, I turned to YouTube for guidance. A specific video caught my attention and provided valuable insights, reorienting me on the right path. However, my progress hit a snag as the API key I had generated came with limitations.

Undeterred, my quest led me to another YouTube channel called "Growing Scientist," where I discovered a video titled "Download Historical Weather Data for Free Without Using API." This innovative approach proved to be the solution I needed, successfully completing the task at hand.

my code

import datetime as dt
import requests

API_KEY = "fc179f8a20e64f8a883173714241001"
CITY = "Lagos"
DATE = "2023-01-05"

BASE_URL = f"http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/history.json?key={API_KEY}&q={CITY}&dt={DATE}"

response = requests.get(BASE_URL)

if response.status_code == 200:
    weather_data = response.json()
    print(weather_data)
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve data. Status code: {response.status_code}")
